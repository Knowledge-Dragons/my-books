Expressions in Python.","body":"\nLambda Expressions\nLambda Expressions are ideally used when we need to do something simple and are more interested in getting the job done quickly rather than formally naming the function. Lambda expressions are also known as anonymous functions.\nLambda Expressions in Python are a short way to declare small and anonymous functions (it is not necessary to provide a name for lambda functions).\nLambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the  def  keyword. They come in handy when you want to define a small function in a concise way. They can contain only one expression, so they are not best suited for functions with control-flow statements.\nSyntax of a Lambda Function\nlambda arguments: expression\nLambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\nExample code\n# Lambda function to calculate square of a number\nsquare = lambda x: x ** 2\nprint(square(3)) # Output: 9\n\n# Traditional function to calculate square of a number\ndef square1(num):\n  return num ** 2\nprint(square(5)) # Output: 25\n\nIn the above lambda example,  lambda x: x ** 2  yields an anonymous function object which can be associated with any name. So, we associated the function object with  square. So from now on we can call the  square  object like any traditional function, for example  square(10)\nExamples of lambda functions\nBeginner\nlambda_func = lambda x: x**2 # Function that takes an integer and returns its square\nlambda_func(3) # Returns 9\n\nIntermediate\nlambda_func = lambda x: True if x**2 &gt;= 10 else False\nlambda_func(3) # Returns False\nlambda_func(4) # Returns True\n\nComplex\nmy_dict = {&quot;A&quot;: 1, &quot;B&quot;: 2, &quot;C&quot;: 3}\nsorted(my_dict, key=lambda x: my_dict[x]%3) # Returns [&#39;C&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;]\n\nUse-case\nLet’s say you want to filter out odd numbers from a  list. You could use a  for  loop:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nfiltered = []\n\nfor num in my_list:\n     if num % 2 != 0:\n         filtered.append(num)\n\nprint(filtered)      # Python 2: print filtered\n# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n\nOr you could write this as a one liner with list-comprehensions:\nfiltered = [x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] if x % 2 != 0]\n\nBut you might be tempted to use the built-in  filter  function. Why? The first example is a bit too verbose and the one-liner can be harder to understand. But  filter  offers the best of both words. What is more, the built-in functions are usually faster.\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nfiltered = filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, my_list)\n\nlist(filtered)\n# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n\nNOTE: in Python 3 built in functions return generator objects, so you have to call  list. In Python 2, on the other hand, they return a  list,  tupleor  string.\nSo what happened? You told  filter  to take each element in  my_list  and apply the lambda expressions. The values that return  False  are filtered out.\nMore Information:\n\nOfficial Docs\n\n\nReference : freeCodeCamp\n\n"},"tutorials/list-append.html":{"url":"tutorials/list-append.html","title":"Python List Append","body":"\n👋 Welcome\nIf you want to learn how to work with  .append()  and  .extend()  and understand their differences, then you have come to the right place. They are powerful list methods that you will definitely use in your Python projects.\nIn this article, you will learn:\n\nHow and when to use the  .append()  method.\nHow and when to use the  .extend()  method.\nTheir main differences.\n\nLet&#39;s begin 🔅\n🔸 Append\nLet&#39;s see how the  .append()  method works behind the scenes.\nUse Cases\nYou should use this method when you want to  add a single item to the end  of a list.\n💡 Tips: You can add items of any data type since lists can have elements of different data types.\n\nSyntax and Arguments\nTo call the  .append()  method, you will need to use this syntax:\n\nFrom Left to Right:\n\nThe list that will be modified. This is usually a variable that references a list.\nA dot, followed by the name of the method  .append().\nWithin parentheses, the item that will be added to the end of the list.\n\n💡  Tips: The dot is very important. This is called &quot;dot notation&quot;. The dot basically says &quot;call this method on this particular list&quot;, so the effect of the method will be applied to the list that is located before the dot.\nExamples\nHere&#39;s an example of how to use  .append():\n# Define the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Add the integer 5 to the end of the existing list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(5)\n\n# See the updated value of the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n💡  Tips:  When you use  .append()  the original list is modified. The method does not create a copy of the list – it mutates the original list in memory.\nLet&#39;s pretend that we are conducting a research and that we want to analyze the data collected using Python. We need to add a new measurement to the existing list of values.\nHow do we do it? We use the  .append()  method!\nYou can see it right here:\n# Existing list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n\n# Add the float (decimal number) to the end of the existing list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(7.34)\n\n# See the updated value of the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 7.34]\n\nEquivalent to...\nIf you are familiar with string, list, or tuple slicing, what  .append()  really does behind the scenes is equivalent to:\na[len(a):] = [x]\n\nWith this example, you can see that they are equivalent.\nUsing  .append():\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(4.52)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 4.52]\n\nUsing list slicing:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums[len(nums):] = [4.52]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 4.52]\n\nAppending a Sequence\nNow, what do you think about this example? What do you think will be output?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append([5.67, 7.67, 3.44])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n# OUTPUT?\n\nAre you ready? This will be the output:\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, [5.67, 7.67, 3.44]]\n\nYou might be asking, why was the full list added as a single item? It&#39;s because the  .append()  method adds the entire item to the end of the list. If the item is a sequence such as a list, dictionary, or tuple, the entire sequence will be added as a single item of the existing list.\nHere we have another example (below). In this case, the item is a tuple and it is added as a single item of the list, not as individual items:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; names = [&quot;Lulu&quot;, &quot;Nora&quot;, &quot;Gino&quot;, &quot;Bryan&quot;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; names.append((&quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;John&quot;))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; names\n[&#39;Lulu&#39;, &#39;Nora&#39;, &#39;Gino&#39;, &#39;Bryan&#39;, (&#39;Emily&#39;, &#39;John&#39;)]\n\n🔸 Extend\nNow let&#39;s dive into the functionality of the  .extend()  method.\nUse Cases\nYou should use this method if you need to  append several items to a list as individual items.\nLet me illustrate the importance of this method with a familiar friend that you just learned: the  .append()  method. Based on what you&#39;ve learned so far, if we wanted to add several  individual items to a list using  .append(), we would need to use  .append()  several times, like this:\n# List that we want to modify\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n\n# Appending the items\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(2.3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(9.6)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(4.564)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.append(7.56)\n\n# Updated list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 2.3, 9.6, 4.564, 7.56]\n\nI&#39;m sure that you are probably thinking that this would not be very efficient, right? What if I need to add thousands or millions of values? I cannot write thousands or millions of lines for this simple task. That would take forever!\nSo let&#39;s see an alternative. We can store the values that we want to add in a separate list and then use a for loop to call  .append()  as many times as needed:\n# List that we want to modify\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n\n# Values that we want to add\n&gt;&gt;&gt; new_values = [2.3, 9.6, 4.564, 7.56]\n\n# For loop that is going to append the value\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for num in new_values:\n    nums.append(num)\n\n# Updated value of the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 2.3, 9.6, 4.564, 7.56]\n\nThis is more efficient, right? We are only writing a few lines. But there is an even more efficient, readable, and compact way to achieve the same purpose:  .extend()!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; new_values = [2.3, 9.6, 4.564, 7.56]\n\n# This is where the magic occurs! No more for loops\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums.extend(new_values)\n\n# The list was updated with individual values\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nums\n[5.6, 7.44, 6.75, 4.56, 2.3, 2.3, 9.6, 4.564, 7.56]\n\nLet&#39;s see how this method works behind the scenes.\nSyntax and Arguments\nTo call the  .extend()  method, you will need to use this syntax:\n\nFrom Left to Right:\n\nThe list that will be modified. This is usually a variable that refers to the list.\nA dot  .  (So far, everything is exactly the same as before).\nThe name of the method  extend. (Now things start to change...).\nWithin parentheses, an  iterable (list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) that contains the items that will be added as individual elements of the list.\n\n💡 Tips:  According to the  Python documentation, an iterable is defined as &quot;an object capable of returning its members one at a time&quot;. Iterables can be used in a for loop and because they return their elements one at a time, we can &quot;do something&quot; with each one of them, one per iteration.\nBehind the Scenes\nLet&#39;s see how  .extend()  works behind the scenes. Here we have an example:\n# List that will be modified\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Sequence of values that we want to add to the list a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [5, 6, 7]\n\n# Calling .extend()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n\n# See the updated list. Now the list a has the values 5, 6, and 7\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\nYou can think of  .extend()  as a method that appends the individual elements of the iterable in the same order as they appear.\nIn this case, we have a list  a = [1, 2, 3, 4]  as illustrated in the diagram below. We also have a list  b = [5, 6, 7]  that contains the sequence of values that we want to add. The method takes each element of  b  and appends it to list  a  in the same order.\n\nStep 1. First element is appended.\n\nStep 2. Second element appended.\n\nStep 3. Third element appended\nAfter this process is completed, we have the updated list  a  and we can work with the values as individual elements of  a.\n\n💡  Tips:  The list  b  used to extend list  a  remains intact after this process. You can work with it after the call to  .extend(). Here is the proof:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [5, 6, 7]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n# List b is intact!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\n[5, 6, 7]\n\nExamples\nYou may be curious to know how the  .extend()  method works when you pass different types of iterables. Let&#39;s see how in the following examples:\nFor tuples:The process works exactly the same if you pass a tuple. The individual elements of the tuple are appended one by one in the order that they appear.\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Values that will be added (the iterable is a tuple!)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Method call\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n\n# The value of the list a was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nFor sets:The same occurs if you pass a set. The elements of the set are appended one by one.\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Values that will be appended (the iterable is a set!)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = {5, 6, 7}\n\n# Method call\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(c)\n\n# The value of a was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\nFor strings:Strings work a little bit different with the  .extend()  method. Each character of the string is considered an &quot;item&quot;, so the characters are appended one by one in the order that they appear in the string.\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]\n\n# String that will be used to extend the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;\n\n# Method call\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n\n# The value of a was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;,&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;W&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;!&#39;]\n\nFor dictionaries:Dictionaries have a particular behavior when you pass them as arguments to  .extend(). In this case, the  keys of the dictionary are appended one by one. The values of the corresponding key-value pairs are not appended.\nIn this example (below), the keys are &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;f&quot;. These values are appended to the list  a.\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]\n\n# Dictionary that will be used to extend the list\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {&quot;d&quot;: 5, &quot;e&quot;: 6, &quot;f&quot;: 7}\n\n# Method call\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n\n# The value of a was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]\n\nEquivalent to...\nWhat  .extend()  does is equivalent to  a[len(a):] = iterable. Here we have an example to illustrate that they are equivalent:\nUsing  .extend():\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Values that will be appended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (6, 7, 8)\n\n# Method call\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\n\n# The list was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]\nUsing list slicing:\n# List that will be extended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Values that will be appended\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (6, 7, 8)\n\n# Assignment statement. Assign the iterable b as the final portion of the list a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a[len(a):] = b\n\n# The value of a was updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]\n\nThe result is the same, but using  .extend()  is much more readable and compact, right? Python truly offers amazing tools to improve our workflow.\n🔸 Summary of their Differences\nNow that you know how to work with  .append()  and  .extend(), let&#39;s see a summary of their key differences:\n\nEffect:  .append()  adds a single element to the end of the list while  .extend()  can add multiple individual elements to the end of the list.\nArgument:  .append()  takes a single element as argument while  .extend()  takes an iterable as argument (list, tuple, dictionaries, sets, strings).\n\nI really hope that you liked my article and found it helpful.

This isolation allows you to localized the installation of your project’s dependencies, without forcing you to install them system-wide.\nImagine you have two applications, App1 and App2. Both use the package Pak, but require different versions. If you install Pak version 2.3 for App1, you would not be able to run App2 because it requires version 3.1.\nThis is where virtual environments come in handy.\nBenefits:\n\nYou can have multiple environments, with multiple sets of packages, without conflicts among them. This way, different projects’ requirements can be satisfied at the same time.\nYou can easily release your project with its own dependent modules.\n\nHere are two ways you can create Python virtual environments.\nVirtualenv\n[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)  is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. It creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.\nYou can install it with  pip:\npip install virtualenv\n\nVerify the installation with the following command:\nvirtualenv --version\n\nCreate an Environment\nTo create a virtual environment use:\nvirtualenv --no-site-packages my-env\n\nThis creates a folder in the current directory with the name of the environment (my-env/). This folder contains the directories for installing modules and Python executables.\nYou can also specify the Python version you want to work with. Just use the argument  --python=/path/to/python/version. For instance,  python2.7:\nvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 my-env\n\nList Environments\nYou can list the available environments with:\nlsvirtualenv\n\nActivate an Environment\nBefore you can start using the environment you need to activate it:\nsource my-env/bin/activate\n\nThis ensures that only packages under  my-env/  are used.\nYou will notice that the name of the environment is shown on the left of the prompt. This way you can see which is the active environment.\nInstall Packages\nYou can install packages one by one, or by setting a  requirements.txt  file for your project.\npip install some-package\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nIf you want to create a  requirements.txt  file from the already installed packages, run the following command:\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n\nThe file will contain the list of all the packages installed in the current environment, and their respective versions. This will help you release your project with its own dependent modules.\nDeactivate an Environment\nIf you are done working with the virtual environment you can deactivate it with:\ndeactivate\n\nThis puts you back to the system’s default Python interpreter with all its installed libraries.\nDelete an Environment\nSimply delete the environment folder.\nConda\nConda  is a package, dependency and environment management for many languages, including Python.\nTo install Conda, follow these  instructions.\nCreate an Environment\nTo create a virtual environment use:\nconda create --name my-env\n\nConda will create the corresponding folder inside the Conda installation directory.\nYou can also specify which version of Python you want to work with:\nconda create --name my-env python=3.6\n\nList Environments\nYou can list all the available environments with:\nconda info --envs\n\nActivate an Environment\nBefore you can start using the environment you need to activate it:\nsource activate my-env\n\nInstall Packages\nThe same as with  virtualenv.\nDeactivate an Environment\nIf you are done working with the virtual environment you can deactivate it with:\nsource deactivate\n\nRemove an Environment\nIf you want to remove an environment from Conda use:\nconda remove --name my-env\n\n\nReference : freeCodeCamp\n\n"}}}
